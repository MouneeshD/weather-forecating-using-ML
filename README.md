# weather-forecating-using-ML
This project is a simple weather forecasting web application built using machine learning. It predicts the temperature based on historical weather data such as humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
The trained model is connected to a Flask web application, allowing users to enter values and instantly see the predicted temperature.
